# 💀 Daggerheart: Adversary Manager

An essential GM tool for **Daggerheart** in Foundry VTT. Instantly scale adversaries across Tiers, manage their stats, and preview changes with a powerful live dashboard.

## 🌟 Overview & Features

### 🛠️ Adversary Scaling & Management

* **📈 Instant Tier Scaling:** Effortlessly scale any Adversary (Standard, Minion, Horde, Solo, etc.) from Tier 1 to 4 using official benchmarks.
* **👀 Live Preview Dashboard:** Compare "Current" stats vs. "Target Tier" stats side-by-side before applying any changes.
* **🎲 Smart Math & Probabilities:**
    * Automatically recalculates HP, Stress, Difficulty, and Damage Thresholds.
    * Scales Attack modifiers and Damage formulas (including Halved Damage for Hordes).
    * **Hit Chance Calculator:** Displays the probability of the Adversary hitting a PC (and vice-versa) based on Tier rules.
* **✨ Feature Automation:**
    * Auto-updates Experience values based on Tier difference.
    * Suggests and adds new **Features** (e.g., *Relentless*, *Momentum*) appropriate for the target Tier.
    * Allows manual selection/deselection of features via checkboxes.
* **🔧 Manual Overrides:** Full control to manually tweak any specific stat (HP, Damage, Name) directly in the preview window before confirming.
* **📦 Batch & Compendium Support:**
    * Update multiple selected tokens on the canvas simultaneously.
    * Import and auto-scale adversaries directly from Compendiums into your world.
